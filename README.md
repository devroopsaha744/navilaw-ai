# NaviLaw

## Overview
The  **NaviLaw** system integrates the **ReAct** (Reasoning and Action Agentic Architecture) with **RAG** (Retrieval Augmented Generation), powered by the Llama3 70B language model, to manage tasks such as legal advisory, report generation, and case outcome prediction. This setup allows the system to act as an intelligent agent, conducting in-depth research on relevant legal databases and retrieving critical documents from user-uploaded files. Through sophisticated reasoning and document processing, it delivers actionable insights. Utilizing prebuilt tools and models, Law Navigator processes user queries, retrieves relevant legal excerpts, and dynamically generates responses, reports, or predictions, while ensuring real-time interactivity.

- **Document Upload:** Supports uploading multiple PDF documents for analysis and retrieval.
- **Legal Precedent Retrieval:** Automatically retrieves and summarizes relevant legal precedents based on the query.
- **Dynamic Report Generation:** Generates concise legal reports, including key findings, analysis, and recommendations.
- **AI-Powered Search:** Utilizes the Tavily Search tool for supplementary legal research when needed.
