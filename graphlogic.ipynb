      "1. Examine the contract: Review the lease agreement (Ex.PW1/1) to identify the specific terms and conditions that have been breached. In this case, it appears that the defendant/tenant held possession of the suit property beyond the lock-in period of five months, which started from 01.03.2020.\n",

In this case, the plaintiff/landlord offered possession of the suit property and made the necessary payment, but the defendant/tenant did not vacate the property.\n",

      "4. Jurisdiction: In the context of arbitration, the parties can mutually designate the place where arbitration proceedings are to be conducted and the court that will exercise supervisory jurisdiction (irrespective of the place where the cause of action arose or where the property is situated).
